# Word-timestamp-remover
Powershell script to remove track changes timestamp from Word documents 

This PowerShell script let's you remove the timestamp from the track changes function in Word documents.
Maybe for privacy reasons, you don't want to show others, when you work an a Word document but keep your author name in place.
For this scenario, Word has no build-in solution. It only let you choose to supress any data for the track-changes function.

Many user, like me, are out there and looking for a solution to supress or remove the timestamp but keep the author in place. 
Because i couldn't find one, i wrote this script. Feel free to inform me if you have a better (free) solution.
